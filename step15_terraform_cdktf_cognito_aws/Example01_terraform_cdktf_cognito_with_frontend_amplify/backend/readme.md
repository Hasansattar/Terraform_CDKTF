This code defines an infrastructure stack using TypeScript to create an AWS Cognito User Pool and its associated client.


### 1. Imports

```typescript
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack, TerraformOutput } from "cdktf";
import { AwsProvider } from "@cdktf/provider-aws/lib/provider";
import { CognitoUserPool } from "@cdktf/provider-aws/lib/cognito-user-pool";
import { CognitoUserPoolClient } from "@cdktf/provider-aws/lib/cognito-user-pool-client";

```
- **Construct**: A base class for defining constructs in CDK. Constructs are the basic building blocks of CDK applications.
- **TerraformStack**: A class that represents a stack in CDKTF. It manages resources and outputs.
- **TerraformOutput**: A class that allows you to define outputs that can be viewed after deployment.
- **AwsProvider**: Configures the AWS provider for Terraform, enabling you to create AWS resources.
- **CognitoUserPool**: A class to define an Amazon Cognito User Pool, which is a user directory that helps manage sign-up and sign-in functionality.
- **CognitoUserPoolClient**: A class to define a client for the Cognito User Pool, which applications use to authenticate users.



### 2.  AWS Provider Configuration


```typescript
    new AwsProvider(this, "AWS", {
      region: "us-east-1", // You can change this to your desired AWS region
    });

```
AwsProvider: This sets up the AWS provider, specifying the region where resources will be created (in this case, us-east-1). You can change this to any region you prefer.



### 3. Creating a Cognito User Pool

```typescript
    const userPool = new CognitoUserPool(this, "userPool-Amplify", {
      name: "userPool-Amplify", // Name of the user pool
      accountRecoverySetting: {
        recoveryMechanism: [{
          name: "verified_email",
          priority: 1,
        },
        {
          name: "verified_phone_number",
          priority: 2,
        }],
      },
      adminCreateUserConfig: {
        allowAdminCreateUserOnly: false,
      },
      autoVerifiedAttributes: ["email"],
      schema: [
        {
          name: "email",
          required: true,
          mutable: true,
          attributeDataType: "String",
        },
        {
          name: "phone_number",
          required: true,
          mutable: true,
          attributeDataType: "String",
        },
      ],
    });

```
CognitoUserPool: Creates a new user pool with specific configurations.

- **name**: The name of the user pool.
- **accountRecoverySetting**: Configures account recovery options. Here, users can recover their accounts using their verified email or phone number.
- **adminCreateUserConfig**: Specifies settings related to the admin user creation. Setting allowAdminCreateUserOnly to false allows users to sign up themselves.
- **autoVerifiedAttributes**: Specifies which attributes (like email) should be automatically verified when users sign up.
- **schema**: Defines the attributes in the user pool. Here, both email and phone_number are required and mutable.



### 4. Creating a Cognito User Pool Client

```typescript
    const userPoolClient = new CognitoUserPoolClient(this, "userPoolClient-Amplify", {
      name: "CognitoUserPoolClient",
      userPoolId: userPool.id,
      allowedOauthFlows: ["code", "implicit"], // Allowed OAuth flows
      allowedOauthScopes: ["phone", "email", "openid", "profile"], // Allowed OAuth scopes
      callbackUrls: ["http://localhost:8000/"], // Replace with your actual callback URL
      logoutUrls: ["http://localhost:8000/logout"], // Replace with your actual logout URL
      // Enable the Hosted UI
      supportedIdentityProviders: ["COGNITO"],
    });

```
CognitoUserPoolClient: Creates a client for the user pool, which is used by applications to authenticate users.

- **name**: The name of the user pool client.
- **userPoolId**: References the ID of the user pool created earlier.
- **allowedOauthFlows**: Specifies the OAuth flows that the client supports (e.g., "code" and "implicit").
- **allowedOauthScopes**: Specifies the OAuth scopes that the client can request (e.g., access to phone number, email, and user profile).
- **callbackUrls**: URLs that the service can redirect users back to after authentication. This should be your actual callback URL.
- **logoutUrls**: URLs to which users are redirected after logging out.
- **supportedIdentityProviders: Specifies which identity providers are supported. In this case, itâ€™s set to "COGNITO".


### 5. Outputting the User Pool and Client IDs

```typescript
    // Output User Pool ID
    new TerraformOutput(this, "UserPoolId", {
      value: userPool.id,
    });

    // Output User Pool Client ID
    new TerraformOutput(this, "UserPoolClientId", {
      value: userPoolClient.id,
    });

```
TerraformOutput: This creates output variables for the stack, which will be displayed after deployment.

- UserPoolId: Outputs the ID of the created user pool.
- UserPoolClientId: Outputs the ID of the created user pool client.



# Summary
In summary, this CDKTF code sets up an AWS Cognito User Pool and a User Pool Client. It configures various properties for the user pool, including recovery options, auto-verified attributes, and a schema for user attributes. Finally, it outputs the User Pool ID, Client ID, and the Hosted UI URL for user authentication.
